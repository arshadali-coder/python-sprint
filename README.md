# 🐍 Python Sprint

A structured Python learning sprint designed to take learners from **absolute basics** to **logic-driven mini projects**, with a strong emphasis on **thinking clearly, writing clean code, and solving real-world style problems**.

This sprint is not about memorizing syntax. It is about learning **how to think like a programmer**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this sprint is to:

* Build strong Python fundamentals
* Develop logical and conditional thinking
* Encourage clean input validation and formatting
* Transition learners from scripts to **project-style problem solving**

By the end of the sprint, participants should be comfortable writing Python programs that:

* Accept and validate user input
* Apply decision-making logic
* Produce structured, professional output

---

## 🧭 Sprint Structure

The sprint is divided into **three progressive levels**:

### 1️⃣ Beginner Level

Focus:

* Basic input and output
* Variables and data types
* Simple formatting

Outcome:

* Confidence with Python basics
* Comfort interacting with users via CLI

---

### 2️⃣ Intermediate Level

Focus:

* String manipulation
* Conditional logic
* Derived values (calculations from input)

Outcome:

* Ability to extend basic programs
* Understanding how logic changes output

---

### 3️⃣ Advanced Level (Mini Project)

Focus:

* Real-world problem framing
* Input validation
* Multi-layered conditional logic
* Professional, system-like output

Outcome:

* Thinking in terms of systems, not scripts
* Readiness for backend-style logic and tools

---

## 🚀 Advanced Mini Project Overview

**CLI-Based Candidate Profile Evaluation System**

Participants build a command-line tool that:

* Collects candidate details
* Validates inputs strictly
* Derives career stage and readiness
* Generates a professional text-based profile card

This project simulates how real platforms evaluate users internally.

## ⏱ Time Expectations

| Level                   | Expected Time | Hard Limit |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Beginner                | 10–15 minutes | 20 minutes |
| Intermediate            | 20–30 minutes | 40 minutes |
| Advanced (Mini Project) | 30–45 minutes | 60 minutes |

Quality and correctness are prioritized over speed.

---

## 📤 Submission Rules (Summary)

* One Python file per problem
* Original work only
* Follow all stated constraints
* Input validation is mandatory
* Output must be clean and readable

If you cannot explain your code line-by-line, the submission is considered invalid.

---

## 🔐 Integrity Policy

* Googling syntax is allowed
* Copy-pasting full solutions without understanding is prohibited
* Similar or shared submissions may be rejected

This sprint evaluates **thinking**, not typing speed.

---

## 🧠 Who This Sprint Is For

* Absolute beginners starting Python from scratch
* Students who know syntax but struggle with logic
* Learners preparing for projects, internships, or backend development

---

## 🏁 Final Note

Progress is expected to feel uncomfortable at times. That discomfort is intentional.

> If you finish everything easily, you are not being challenged.
> If you struggle but persist, you are learning correctly.

Welcome to the Python Sprint.
